# Probability Distributions

This is the beginning of a series of notebooks discussing various probability distributions. They are intended to build on each other iteratively, in a story, so one can learn probability concepts while learning about each distribution. My goal is to release these eventually as a blog or book; for now they might not make all that much sense.
